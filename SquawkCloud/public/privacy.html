If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites' homepages or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</div><div><br></div><h2>Collection of Information</h2><div><i>Information You Provide to Us</i></div><div><br></div><div>We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, use the Services to send or receive a message (a "Squawk"), request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your username, phone number, and any other information you choose to provide.</div><div><br></div><div>When you send or receive Squawks, we also temporarily collect, process and store the contents of the Squawk on our servers. The contents of Squawks are also temporarily stored on the devices of recipients. Once a Squawk has been viewed by its recipient, we automatically delete the Squawk from our servers and our Services are programmed to delete the Squawk from the recipients’ devices.  We cannot guarantee that deletion always occurs within a particular timeframe. We also cannot prevent others from making copies of your Squawk (e.g. recording with a microphone). In addition, as for any other digital information, there may be ways to access Squawks while still in temporary storage on recipients’ devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted. You should not use Squawk to send messages if you want to be certain that the recipient cannot keep a copy.</div><div><br></div><p><i>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services</i></p><div>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:</div><div><br></div><div>Usage Information: When you send or receive Squawks, we collect information about these messages, including the time, date, sender and recipient of the Squawk.</div><div>Log Information: We log information about your use of our websites, including your browser type and language, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the website you visited before navigating to our websites.</div><div>Device Information: We may collect information about the computer or device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, MAC address, unique device identifier, phone number, International Mobile Equipment Identity ("IMEI") and mobile network information.
