APP STORE TITLE
Squawk — talk, don't text

APP STORE DESCRIPTION
Squawk combines the best of texting with the best of voice. Send quick voice messages to contacts or groups without a single tap—just raise iPhone to your head and speak. It's voice communication for the 21st century. 

No need to sign up—it only takes one tap to get started squawking the people in your contacts. Pick a person, raise your phone to your head (or tap the button) and just start talking. Put down the phone and it's sent. Listening to a squawk is just as easy. It's a more personal, more convenient way to communicate. 

Listened to a squawk, but don't feel like recording a whole response? Tap the checkmark to give the sender a quick "okay" that you've heard their message.
